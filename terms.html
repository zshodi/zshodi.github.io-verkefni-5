    <h1>Terms of Service:</h1>
    <h3>Here is a **single continuous block of text**, still a parody of an obviously terrible AI-written scam ToS:
    By using, touching, looking at, or emotionally acknowledging the Bluetooth Hose you automatically 
    agree to these Terms of Service which you did not read and which we probably didn’t write correctly but here they are anyway: 
    you understand that the Bluetooth Hose may or may not function as a hose, Bluetooth device, or physical object, and any resemblance 
    to a real product is coincidental and mostly accidental since the manufacturing instructions were generated by an AI that misunderstood 
    what a hose is. By agreeing to this you allow us to collect all data you produce including watering habits, personal thoughts, general vibes,
    your WiFi passwords, leftover crumbs in your keyboard, and whatever sound your lawn makes at night. The hose does not come with a
    warranty except the imaginary one we tell you about verbally in a dream you’ll forget upon waking. Payments for the hose are final,
    nonrefundable, irreversible, and payable exclusively in unmarked gift cards or a custom cryptocurrency that only exists on weekends.
    If the hose breaks, explodes, starts glowing, becomes self-aware, or begins shouting Bluetooth pairing codes into the void, that is
    entirely your responsibility and not ours because you should have read the Terms but you didn’t, which is fine because we didn’t either.
    By using the Bluetooth Hose you waive all rights to complain, sue, leave a bad review, think critically about the product, or ask questions
    such as “Why does a hose need Bluetooth?” or “Why is it warm?” All disputes will be settled through interpretive dance or coin flips
    conducted by an unbiased raccoon chosen at random. If you want customer support, please email our automated system which only replies
    with pictures of hoses from 2007. By continuing to exist in proximity to the Bluetooth Hose you accept all current and future terms
    including those we have not invented yet and possibly those we will invent retroactively. Thank you for choosing Bluetooth Hose, the world’s
    first hose that does not need Bluetooth and also does not really have it.
